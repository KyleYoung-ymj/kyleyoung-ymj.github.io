## My Experiences

- I was born in 2000 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.

- I participated in programming competitions of OI (Olympiad in Informatics) and [ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)](https://icpc.global/) during my senior high and undergraduate time, respectively. You can find my [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) account [here](https://codeforces.com/profile/KyleYoung).
