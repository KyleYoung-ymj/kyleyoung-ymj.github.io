I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/en), Renmin University of China, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Ji-Rong Wen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/jrwen) and Prof. [Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/). Before my graduate studies, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), Renmin University of China in June 2022.

My research interests are centered around **theoretical computer science (TCS)** and **data mining**, with a particular focus on **sublinear-time graph algorithms** and **spectral graph theory**. Although my knowledge in TCS is limited by far, I have a broad interest and strong passion for this field. My current works mainly concentrate on efficient approximation of **PageRank** and **Personalized PageRank** values, which are celebrated node centrality and proximity measures on graphs. I am actively learing some elementary books and courses to broaden my knowledge in TCS.
