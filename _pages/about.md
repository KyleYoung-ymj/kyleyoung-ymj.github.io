I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. candidate at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/en), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Ji-Rong Wen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/jrwen) and Prof. [Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/). Before my graduate studies, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn) in June 2022.

My research interests include theoretical computer science, graph algorithms, and sublinear algorithms.
