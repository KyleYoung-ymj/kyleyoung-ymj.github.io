I am currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/en), Renmin University of China, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Ji-Rong Wen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/jrwen/) and [Prof. Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/).
In June 2022, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at Turing Class, [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), Renmin University of China.

During the spring of 2025, I was visiting the [Institute for Theoretical Computer Science](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/main.htm), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Tsz Chiu Kwok](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/54/20/c10495a152608/page.htm).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a focus on **sublinear graph algorithms** and **spectral graph theory**.
My current work centers on efficient algorithms for estimating (Personalized) PageRank and their connections to solving linear systems and local graph clustering.
I am also expanding my research to the [Laplacian Paradigm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13562-0_2) [(2.0)](https://sachdevasushant.github.io/laplacian2.0/), streaming algorithms, and property testing.
My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3.
