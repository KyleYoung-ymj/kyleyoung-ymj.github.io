I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/en), Renmin University of China, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Ji-Rong Wen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/jrwen/) and [Prof. Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/).
Before my graduate studies, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at Turing Class, [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), Renmin University of China in June 2022.

During the spring of 2025, I was visiting the [Institute for Theoretical Computer Science](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/main.htm), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Tsz Chiu Kwok](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/54/20/c10495a152608/page.htm).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, with a current focus on **spectral graph algorithms** and **sublinear graph algorithms**.
My published works concentrate on efficient approximation of **PageRank** and **Personalized PageRank** values, which are celebrated node centrality and proximity measures on graphs.
I am expanding my research to the **[Laplacian Paradigm](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13562-0_2)** **[(2.0)](https://sachdevasushant.github.io/laplacian2.0/)**, property testing, streaming algorithms, and approximate counting & sampling.
