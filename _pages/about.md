I am currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. candidate at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.ruc.edu.cn/en), Renmin University of China, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Ji-Rong Wen](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/jrwen) and Prof. [Zhewei Wei](https://weizhewei.com/). Before my graduate studies, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), Renmin University of China in June 2022.

My research interests are centered around **theoretical computer science** and **data mining**, with a particular focus on approximate and probabilistic **sublinear-time graph algorithms**. I am passionate about devising algorithms with elegant and strong theoretical guarantees. My current works mainly concentrate on efficient approximation of PageRank and Personalized PageRank values, which are celebrated node centrality and proximity measures on graphs.
