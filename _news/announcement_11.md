From Feb. to June 2025, I will be visiting [Prof. Tsz Chiu Kwok](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/54/20/c10495a152608/page.htm) at the [Institute for Theoretical Computer Science](https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/main.htm), [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/), focusing on spectral graph algorithms. Many thanks to Prof. Tsz Chiu Kwok, and I am looking forward to the new opportunities and connections!
